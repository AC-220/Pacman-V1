# Pacman-V1
Python Pacman Game

This project involved using Pygame and object oriented programming to develop a basic game of pacman using a graphical user interface and interactive controls.

The game works as follows:
• The enemy moves automatically in the direction where the food is located.
• Pacman is controlled by a keyboard input.
• If Pacman eats the Food before the Enemy, then both Pacman and the Food relocate.
• If the Enemy eats the Food before Pacman, then the Enemy and the Food relocate.
• If the Enemy hits Pacman, then both Pacman and the Enemy relocate.
The game is continuous until the player closes the window
